text on missing data:

if e.g. read-nest dies, you get a message for each of the variables it updates .. they are all missing. should find a nice way to consolidate messages, e.g. missing data from the read-nest process vs missing data from the channel

watch extended to read-remotes:

should read-remotes be part of the watch list for watch.py?

fix ugly startup on duty cycle and period in nest.py
